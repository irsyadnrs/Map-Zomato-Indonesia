# Map-Zomato-Indonesia
Data Visualization using leaflet in R
This is my result after studied on day 15 in dibimbing.id with "Data Visualization" topics. I'm using leaflet function which is good to show visualization, especially for mapping.

I'm using 'Zomato Restaurant' dataset from kaggle.com. Basically, the dataset has existed since 2018, so isn't updated yet. The dataset contains of all restaurants which is available at Zomato, but I just used that based in Indonesia.

Goals from this visualization are for showing restaurants based on ratings, type of foods also details address. I have to learn a lot to make good visualization, so I really wait for the critics or suggestions.

Here are some capture and if you wanna know about video, you can check my linkedin postðŸ‘‡
